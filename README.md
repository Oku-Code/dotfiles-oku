# Dotfiles - Oku

Here are some dotfiles for my configurations, and this readme to have a guide how to use and configure for the following programs:

1. Neovim-old: configure with Coc, Nerdtree, Ale and some themes, keymaps and more.
2. Nvim-new: configure with lua, Packer and more
2. Alacritty: make it pretty, that's it.
3. Kitty: make it pretty as well.
4. Emacs: a pretty extensive init.el configuration, with melpa, evil mode and more.
5. Fish: more customizable, with omf and the appropiated paths for deno and rust.

> This will have changes so be careful with this configs :)
